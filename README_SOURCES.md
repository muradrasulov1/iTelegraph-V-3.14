ALL THE MAIN CHANGES WERE MADE IN APP.C AND HOST_KEYBOARD.C. HOWEVER, SINCE SDK-GIVEN HELPER CODE WAS USED, SDK-GIVEN KEYBOARD FUNCTIONS ARE ALSO PRESENT IN SOURCES FOLDER.
TO POWER ALL THESE FUNCTIONS, THE DRIVERS FOLDER CONTAINS CODE NEEDED FOR THE TSI, KEYBOARD AND SW1, SW2 PERIPHERALS.
IF YOU EVER NEED TO RUN THE CODE, SIMPLY CREATE A NEW PROJECT WITH UART ENABLED AND IMPORT EVERY FOLDER IN THE REPOSITORY.
